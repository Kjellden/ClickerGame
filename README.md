# Overview

This is what is known as a clicker game. You make progress by clicking on the coin and upgrading your heros.
One of them will make it so you make more money per click and the others will make it so you make money over time.
The point of this game is to get as much money as you can thats it some people find these game very fun and you can
add endless upgrades to them making them endls fun.


The purpose of writing this game was to better understand python and classes and also go over the the arcade library worked in python. I like making fun games like this to gain an understanding of objects in programing.
